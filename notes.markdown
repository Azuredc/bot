1. TODO list can be achieved in the Projects tab or / with the Issues tab (Milestones)
2. Handling versions and changelogs is also possible through the issues / releases tabs.
3. SHA-1 hashes of commits and Issues / PRs references might work just in the commit message / Issues / PRs tabs. (not sure)
4. Wiki can be achieved through github's wiki system or through a gh-pages page (https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki)
5. sorry if i did something wrong
